LinguaCafe is a free self-hosted software that helps language learners acquire vocabulary by reading. It provides a set of tools to read, look up unknown words and review them later as effortlessly as possible.

You can read about all the features of LinguaCafe on the [overview](https://simjanos-dev.github.io/LinguaCafeHome/) GitHub Page, and on the [user manual](https://github.com/simjanos-dev/LinguaCafe/wiki/1.-Home) GitHub Wiki page.

## Language support

**Supported languages:** Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Macedonian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Welsh.

You can find a detailed list about what level of support different languages have on the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/simjanos-dev/LinguaCafe/wiki) page.

## Supported platforms:
- x64, which includes most desktop computers made in the last decade.
- Mac users with Apple silicon must perform an additional step, see the 'Installation' section for details

Other Armv8 devices such as Raspberry Pis 3 and newer do not work at the moment.

## Memory usage
LinguaCafe uses RAM based on how many and which languages do you use. If you use every language, the RAM usage can be over 2GB.

## Installation

The installation process may seem a bit strange to some people. It is just a simple docker compose file, except that the git pull command pulls some empty folder structure, and some default files. You might understand it better, if you take a look at the `deploy` branch.

Step 1: Install docker desktop and git.

Step 2: Run the following commands from the location where you want to store your files:

##### Linux and MacOs:
```
git clone https://github.com/simjanos-dev/linguacafe-docker.git linguacafe-docker && cd linguacafe-docker
```

If you want to change the default MySQL database and user, you can create a `.env` file and add these lines to it before starting your servers for the first time:
```
LINGUACAFE_DB="linguacafe"
LINGUACAFE_ROOT="linguacafe"
LINGUACAFE_PASSWORD="linguacafe"
LINUACAFE_ROOT_PASSWORD="linguacafe"

NOTE: You can modify the credentials as you wish. These are just the default values.
```

Run the remaining commands:
```
chmod -R 777 ./ && docker compose up -d
```

## Troubleshooting
Check the Wiki Page for troubleshooting issues.

#### v0.9 Mac changes

If you are a Mac user with Apple silicon, and you had to uncomment a line in the `docker-compose.yml` file before, please follow these instructions before you update:

Step 1: Comment the the line again at the end of the `docker-compose.yml` file :
```
volumes:
    - ./storage:/var/www/html/storage
networks:
    - linguacafe
# platform: linux/amd64
```

Step 2: Create a `.env` file in the linguacafe, and add the this line to it:

```
PLATFORM="linux/amd64"
```

This change will will simplify the update process, and prevent any possible conflict errors with the git pull command in the future.

##### Linux and MacOs:
```
git pull && docker compose pull && docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

##### Windows
On Windows, you can run again [the installation script](/install_linguacafe.bat) to update to the latest version, or run the commands separately:
```
git pull
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

## Importing dictionaries
Step 1: Download the dictionaries that you want to use from the provided links below.

Step 2: Copy the dictionary files to your `linguacafe/storage/app/dictionaries` folder.

Step 3: Go to the Admin -> Dictionaries page in LinguaCafe. Click on the `Import dictionary` button.

Step 4: This dialog will list all your importable dictionaries that are found in your `dictionaries` folder. Click on the `import` button for the dictionary that you want to import.

After the import process is finished, your dictionary should be working.

#### JMDict
Languages: Japanese

Download: [GitHub release](https://github.com/simjanos-dev/LinguaCafe/releases/tag/dictionaries)

All these 4 files are required to import JMDict:

- radicals.txt

This dictionary contains kanji and radicals for the Japanese language. Some Japanese features do not work without importing this dictionary.

This dictionary's license only allow personal use.

#### Custom dictionary
You can also import a custom dictionary file in the form of a .csv file.

#### DeepL translate
DeepL is a machine translation service that let's you translate up to 500.000 characters/month for free and is supported by LinguaCafe. You can set your DeepL Translate API key in the admin API settings.

You must enable DeepL translate for each language on the Admin -> Dictionaries page.

## Jellyfin configuration
You can use the network configuration from this example to connect Jellyfin's network with LinguaCafe. There are probably multiple ways to do it, the only requirement is that linguacafe-webserver should be able to reach Jellyfin's server to make API requests.

```
version: '3.5'
networks:
    linguacafe_linguacafe:
        external: true

services:
    jellyfin:
        image: jellyfin/jellyfin
        container_name: jellyfin
        user: 1000:1000
        volumes:
            - /path/to/config:/config
            - /path/to/cache:/cache
            - /path/to/media:/media:ro
        restart: 'unless-stopped'
        ports:
            - 8096:8096
        networks:
            - linguacafe_linguacafe
```

You must name your subtitle files in a way that Jellyfin will recognize as languages. These worked for me:  
```
Series Name - S01E01.ja.ass  
Series Name - S01E01.de.ass  
Movie name.es.ass  
```  

Language codes for subtitle filenames that Jellyfin recognizes: Chinese: `zh`, Czech: `cs`, Dutch: `nl`, English: `en`, Finnish: `fi`, French: `fr`, German: `de`, Greek: `el`, Italian: `it`, Japanese: `ja`, Korean: `ko`, Latin: `la`, Norwegian: `no`, Russian: `ru`, Spanish: `es`, Swedish: `sv`, Ukrainian: `uk`, Welsh: `cy`

[Jellyfin external file naming](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/server/media/external-files/)

#### Possible error codes in browser console while importing from Jellyfin:
`unsupported language code: spa`: This means that Jellyfin recognized the language of the subtitle, but it is not supported by LinguaCafe yet. If you find one of these, please open a GitHub Issue, this should be fixed.  

`unsupported language code: unrecognized by jellyfin: japaaaneseee`: This means that Jellyfin did not recognize `japaaaneseee` as a language, and it can only be fixed by renaming the file following Jellyfin's naming conventions.  

If you have file naming issues and renamed a file, make sure you refresh metadata in Jellyfin before reloading LinguaCafe.

## Jellyfin API usage
Step 1: Create an API key in Jellyfin. You can do this on the Dashboard -> API Keys menu.

Step 2: Set the created API key in LinguaCafe on to the Admin->API menu.

Step 3: Set the Jellyfin host in LinguaCafe on to the Admin->API menu. If you used the pre-written configs, it should be the default http://jellyfin:8096.

Step 4: Save the settings.

Now you can import subtitles from Jellyfin.

## Anki
Anki is supported, if your server and Anki run on the same PC (this will not be a requirement in the future) and have [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) plugin installed.

## Active development disclaimer
LinguaCafe is still in active development. There are missing features, and you might encounter some bugs while using the software. Please test it before you start actively using it, and make sure it is up to your expectations.

At this time only one user/server is supported.
